# SimplifycOS
#### A graphical operating system made by Daniel M using PyQt
## Run
To run the program, run the main.py file using the `python3 main.py` bash command
## Required libraries
This program mostly uses the _PyQt5_ GUI library, but uses the _PyQtWebEngine_ library to access web content. For more on these libraries, visit https://pypi.org/project/PyQtWebEngine/ and https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/.
If the PyQt5 or PyQtWebEngine library is not installed, the program will show a prompt to install the library. To install, enter 'install'. Alternatively, manually run the `pip3 install PyQt5` (to install PyQt5) and/or the `pip3 install PyQtWebEnigne` (to install PyQt WebEngine) bash command, depending on the missing library.
